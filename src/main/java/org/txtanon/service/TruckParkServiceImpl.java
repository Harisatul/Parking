    /**
     * Adds a truck to the parking lot on the specified floor.
     * The idea is, iterate through floor and specified floor to find 2-index empty space.
     *
     * example 1 = {sedan, null, null, sedan, sedan} ==> floor2
     *            when iterate over array, index- 1 is null. Then we also check next index[i+1].
     *            if the next index is also empty, we can assign new Truck Object to the parking lot
     *            on that floor at index i and index i+1. so basically we put same truck object to two index respectively.
     * example 2 = {sedan, null, sedan, sedan, null} ==> floor2
     *            when iterate over array, index- 1 is null. Then we also check next index[i+1].
     *            in this case next index of i [i+1] isn't null. so we can't add new truck object since Truck object has
     *            2 size. Even though there is empty space on last index. we can't still add cause we should put Truck object
     *            respectively.
     *
     * if empty space was found
     * we assign that space with new Object of Sedan with calling parkRepository.save() and passing required value.
     * There is check if the parking lot has already same Car that we want to add.
     * Then, check if park is full. return exception
